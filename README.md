# The Best Places to visit this Summer by TripAdvisor
### Canâ€™t decide where to spend the dog days of summer? This list of top summer spots is guaranteed to have at least one destination perfect for you. (Spoiler: Most of them are on the coast!)

### In this project, I have used the [TripAdvisor's](https://www.tripadvisor.com/) post to identify the top destinations to be considered to be visited this Summer. I have used Selenium and Python to build a web scraper which traverses the site and obtains necessary data regarding the locations and converts the data into CSV format to be viewed. 

### To run the software application, following are steps:
1) Download the repository in your system.
2) Make sure you have 'Selenium' installed (You can 'pip install selenium'!!).
3) You need to have Chrome Driver on your system (Download [here](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)).
4) Note down the path where chrome driver is downloaded.
5) Open 'best-locations.py' file. 
6) Edit the path on line no. 8 of the file.
7) Run it.

### Upon running the file, you would have a 'best_locations.csv' file exported to your working directory. Have a look at it and decide which place suits you the most to chill around in the coming days of Summer!!!
